I have imaplemented the backend and frontend both. So After running this project on your local machine you will see the login page you need to login the application by passing 
the loging creadential which are provided in assignment doc.
After successFull Login You will see the customer list page. This Page contains the data present in the database in table form with one more column action column this 
column has two buttons the first one is delete and edit. 
so by clicking on delete button the DELETE API will call and the id of the entry will be passed as the parameter and this data will be remove/delete from the database and from the table also.
Clicking on edit button you can edit the any of that specific customer.
there are more buttons on this page ADD CUSTOMER, SEARCH BY and SEARCH with INPUT field.
SEARCH BY is a dropdown you will see the column name after clicking it. After selecting the column name you can search for the with the specifing column name value.
(ex. Select "City" from dropdown then enter "Delhi" in SEARCH INPUT FIELD and then click on SEARCH button
it will shows the data with that city name.)
Clicking on ADD CUSTOMER button you will able to add the new entry in Databse as well as in the table.
There is one more option SYNC after clicking this the database we get the new entries of customer and if some data is already exist it will update it accordingly.
